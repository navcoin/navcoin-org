          <p>The Navcoin decentralized autonomous organization (hereafter “Navcoin DAO”) is dedicated to your privacy. </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>This privacy policy is primarily intended to inform you about the processing of your personal data on the websites published and maintained by the Navcoin DAO (hereafter: “Websites”) as well as our social media channels and the rights to which you are entitled under data protection law. Any personal data is collected and processed in accordance with this privacy policy and the General European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The list of Websites can be found in our Terms of Use section. </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>By using the Websites, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
          <p>This information does not apply to the websites of third parties and the corresponding links given on our Websites. </p>
          <p>‍<br></p>
          <h4>1. Responsible for data protection</h4>
          <p>‍</p>

          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>2. Scope of the processing of personal data</h4>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We will only collect and use the personal data of our users to the extent that is necessary for the functionality of the Websites and the provision of services and content. When using our Websites for purely information purposes, we will not collect any personal data, with the exception of the data transmitted by your browser and the information (IP address, etc.) in server log files that our hosting provider may collect. With the exception of the hosting provider for our Websites, we do not share any personally identifying information publicly or with third parties, except when required to by law.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We are entitled to transfer your personal data to third parties abroad for the purposes of the data processing described in this Privacy Policy. These recipients are obliged to protect data privacy to the same extent as described in this Privacy Policy. If the level of data protection in a given country does not correspond to the European Union’s data protection level, we can ensure that the protection of your personal data corresponds to that in the European Union at all times by complying with the GDPR.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><em>E-Mail</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>You may contact us by e-mail to one of the e-mail addresses provided on the Websites. In order to process this your e-mail sent to us, you must (voluntarily) provide the following information: name/alias, subject, e-mail address, message. We use this data, which you may give voluntarily, only in order to answer your reply to your e-mail in the best possible manner.</p>

          <p>At the end of each newsletter email a link is provided that enables you to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><em>Social Media</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>The Websites may include links to social networks such as, Discord, Reddit, GitHub, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and others on our websites. By clicking these links, the operators of the respective social networks may record that you are on our websites and may use this information. It is the responsibility of these third party platforms to implement their privacy policy that is not within our purview. The Navcoin DAO is not responsible for data collected by these third party platforms.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>3. Security of your data</h4>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We use appropriate security measures to protect your stored personal data against manipulation, partial or complete loss, and access by unauthorized third parties. Our security measures are continuously being improved and in line with technical developments.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>Be aware that any data transmission on the internet (e.g. communication by e- mail) is generally not secure and we accept no liability for data transmitted to us via internet.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>4. Duration of data storage</h4>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>Processing and storage of personal data will only be done for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the applicable laws or regulations. If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the applicable laws expires, personal data is routinely erased in accordance with the legal requirements.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>5. Your rights as data subject</h4>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>If your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the meaning of the GDPR. The applicable data protection law grants you extensive data subject rights which we inform you about below:</p>

          <p><em>Withdrawal of consent (Article 7(3) GDPR)</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>If you have given your consent to the collection or use of personal data, you can withdraw this at any time by e-mail with effect for the future. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><em>Right of access (Article 15 GDPR)</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not, and which personal data concerning you we process. On request, we shall send you this information in writing via e-mail.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><em>Right to rectification (Article 16 GDPR)</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>You have the right to obtain the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you and to have incomplete personal data completed.</p>
          <p>‍</p>

          <p>‍</p>
          <p><em>Right to restriction of processing (Article 18 GDPR)</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>You have the right to obtain restriction of processing of your data under certain conditions.</p>

          <p><em>Right to data portability (Article 20 GDPR)</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>You have the right to data portability, which means the right to receive the personal data you have provided to us. Please contact us via e-mail for that purpose.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>6. Cookies</h4>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer’s hard drive. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our site.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We use cookies to keep track of whether you have pressed the “OK” button on the cookie disclaimer, so we don’t bother you with the notification if you have. Our Analytics software (Google Analytics) uses cookies to measure and better understand user-interactions on our Site. You can read more about how Google Analytics uses cookies below.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p><em>Google Analytics</em></p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We use a third-party JavaScript plug-in provided by Google called “Google Analytics” to provide us with useful traffic statistics and to better understand how you use our site. We do not have direct access to the information obtained from Google Analytics, but Google provides us with a summary through their dashboard.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We may share the information obtained from Google Analytics with business partners who are interested in advertising on our website. The information shared with these business partners will not contain any personally identifying information (Google does not provide us with direct access to the data and therefore we cannot see this information).</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>You can opt-out of having your information collected by Google Analytics by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on provided by Google. This will prevent your information being used by Google Analytics. Doing this will not affect your ability to use our Site in any way. You can download the opt-out browser add-on here. We also honor the Do Not Track header and will not track visitors who have Do Not Track switched on.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
