These documents cover guiding principles, purpose, scope of work and operational requirements to ensure we share the same values and always operate in the best interests of the network."

paragraphText="As contributors to the NavCoin community we are members of one of the world’s first functioning anarcho-syndicalist societies. This revolutionary system is based on the belief that when people are free to act in their own best interests they naturally work in the best interests of society as well. Another way to describe to anarcho-syndicalism is decentralization."

  paragraphText="Decentralized digital currencies like NavCoin take control of the monetary system away from government and corporate elites and returns freedom, privacy and financial power to the individual. That’s why NavCoin is not just a payments protocol, it’s actually a vector for a profound change in the way the global economic system operates. Decentralized governance is at its heart. Because there is no central authority for NavCoin, a crucial part of our role as members of this community is to be champions of neutrality and consensus based decision making. "

titleText="Benefits of decentralisation"
imgSrc="/images/governance/gov-benifits.svg"
paragraphText="Decentralization also offers protection from corruption. History has shown us countless times that too much power in too few hands inevitably leads to its abuse. What’s more it gives the individual a chance to make a real difference. Improvements to the protocol come from the bottom up, and can be submitted by anyone. NavCoin’s thriving community is living proof that when people are trusted to do good, they will contribute for the good of all."

  titleText="It all depends on you"

  paragraphText="When everyone in the NavCoin community takes responsibility for contributing to the development of the protocol and is actively pushing it’s message out to the world, not only does the community benefit, the benefits spreads to society as a whole. Conversely, without your participation as an empowered autonomous individual there can be no decentralization, and hence no NavCoin. NavCoin’s success truly is up to you, and you are free to make it happen."
