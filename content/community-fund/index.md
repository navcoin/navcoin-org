        <h1>Community Fund</h1>
        <p>The NavCoin community fund is a pool of funds that are set aside to help kickstart community projects. NavCoin was built from the ground up - it’s an open-source community project that ran no premine or ICO. So as an extension of this ethos, this fund has been created to help incentivise the ongoing development of NavCoin in a decentralised manner.Anyone and everyone on the network will be able to propose projects, vote, and initiate payments. These proposals can be for anything - the only requirement is for the network to vote ‘yes’.</p>
