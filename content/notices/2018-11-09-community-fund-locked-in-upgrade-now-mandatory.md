  - Mandatory Update
---
The Community Fund soft fork has successfully passed network consensus with over 83% of blocks voting in favour of the consensus change on just the third voting period since version 4.4.0 was released.
<!--more-->
This means soft fork is now locked-in and the consensus change will activate at block height 2,620,800. After this block, nodes running 4.3.x and below have an increasing risk of ending up on a fork from the main chain and forking will become unavoidable when the first payment request is processed.

It is highly recommended to upgrade to version 4.4.0 as soon as possible to avoid any problems after the consensus change activates. After the soft fork activates, the upgrade is considered mandatory and all older versions of NavCoin Core become deprecated.

There are two additional soft forks which have also locked in. 

<https://www.navexplorer.com/soft-forks>

These are described in the NPIP's below:

**Community Fund Acummulation Chain Size reduction**

<https://github.com/NAVCoin/npips/blob/master/npip-0003.mediawiki>

**Increase Community Fund Contribution**

<https://github.com/NAVCoin/npips/blob/master/npip-0005.mediawiki>

All three consensus updates are part of NavCoin Core 4.4.0 and will be activated at the same block height. All you need to do is update to 4.4.0 and all of these will be accounted for.

All known exchanges and economic nodes have been notified of the mandatory update. This notice is considered a public service announcement and resolves NavCoin Core's obligation to inform the network of critical updates.

If you have any questions or problems updating, please join the NavCoin Discord server for support.
