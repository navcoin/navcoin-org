The launch of our very much awaited new private coin xNAV was kickstarted two weeks ago on January 1st with the publishing of the Navcoin Core 6.0 release candidate binaries.

After being able to get the builds battle-tested on mainnet during the testing period, the builds have shown to be stable and with no major reported issues.

As of today, we are ready to make the final version available for our community to download from our Github releases page.

# Navcoin v6.0 Release Notes

## blsCT: Boneh–Lynn–Shacham Confidential Transactions

<[Pull Request 743](https://github.com/navcoin/navcoin-core/pull/743)>

This PR proposes a consensus change signaled by version bit 10 to signal the activation of the blsCT protocol in the mainnet starting on February 1, 2021.

Read more details about blsCT in [doc.nav.community](https://doc.nav.community/blsct.html)

## [DAO] Exclude inactive stakers from votings

<[Pull Request 745](https://github.com/navcoin/navcoin-core/pull/745)>

This PR proposes a consensus change signaled by version bit 12 starting on February 1, 2021 to allow excluding stakers from the DAO votings.

Nodes (like users who do not want to participate in the votings or exchanges which activate staking) will be able to exclude their staked blocks from the quorum by indicating the option -excludevote=1, preventing a scenario where a big enough amount of staking coins not engaging in the governance process could make impossible to reach the acceptance/rejection thresholds.

Additionally, a node will label automatically their blocks to be excluded even if -excludevote=1 is no specified, whenever the staker hasn't been active voting in any of the last 10 voting cycles which had an active vote. This is reverted whenever the staker casts a vote.

Blocks are labeled to be excluded by activating the right-most bit of their nOnce parameter.

## Add support for wallet database encryption
