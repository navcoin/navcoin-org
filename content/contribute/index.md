    <p>NavCoin is free software and any developer can contribute to the project. Everything you need is in the GitHub repository. Please make sure to read and follow the development process described in the README, as well as to provide good quality code and respect all guidelines.</p>

    txtColor="#7a7a7a">}}
    <p>There is a whole eco-system of software which developers have created to operate on or alongside the NavCoin protocol. All software the NavCoin Core developers create is also free and open-source. Any developer can contribute to these projects through the many <a href="https://github.com/NAVCoin" class="dark-grey-txt-underline" target="e">NavCoin GitHub</a> repositories.</p>

    <p>Development discussion for each project takes place on GitHub. Less formal development discussion happens on the <a href="https://discord.gg/y4Vu9jw" class="dark-grey-txt-underline" target="e">NavCoin Discord</a>.</p>

    <p>Don’t forget that NavCoin is simply a protocol. Anyone can build their own wallet, service, website, application or space suit that implements NavCoin.</p>

    title="Code Review"
    txtColor="#7a7a7a">}}
    <p>NavCoin and its associated projects are security software that help protect assets worth millions of dollars, so every code change needs to be reviewed by experienced developers. It can take a long time for other developers to review your pull requests. Remember that all reviewers are taking time away from their own projects to review your pull requests, so be patient and respectful of their time.</p>

    <p>Please also consider helping to review other people’s pull requests. You don’t need to be an expert in NavCoin, the NavCoin Core codebase, or C++ (although all these things help). There are almost always open pull requests that any programmer can review.</p>

    <p>Do you want to begin coding for NavCoin but don’t have a specific improvement in mind? Here are a few ideas:</p>
    <h3>Fix existing issues</h3>
    <p>The issue tracker for each repository is the best place to find a useful way to contribute to NavCoin. Before starting to write any patches for issues you find, you may want to comment on the issue to make sure nobody else is already working on it.</p>
    <h3>Write tests</h3>
    <p>NavCoin’s various softwares are covered by many tests, but patches that improve test coverage are always welcome and are a great way to build familiarity with the codebase. See the documentation about automated testing.</p>
