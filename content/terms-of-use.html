          <p>‍</p>
          <p>The Navcoin DAO does not provide individual or customized legal, tax, financial, or investment services. Since each individual’s situation is unique, a qualified professional should be consulted before making financial decisions.

          <h4>6. Exclusion of limitations and disclaimers</h4>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>Because some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such jurisdictions the Navcoin DAO’s liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
